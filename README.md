# Poketo CLI

Download manga chapters from the command-line. An example use-case for the [poketo](https://github.com/poketo/poketo) scraping library.

This CLI is entirely functional, but is still a work-in-progress. Feedback is welcome!

## Usage

Install the CLI from [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/poketo-cli).

```bash
npm i -g poketo-cli
```

### Downloading a chapter

To download a chapter, paste the chapter's reader url after the `poketo` command. For example:

```
$ poketo https://jaiminisbox.com/reader/read/my-hero-academia/en/0/181/page/1

✓ Found chapter: Chapter 181: For Someone Else's Sake
✓ Downloaded 15 pages to ./
```

### Downloading a series

To download a series, paste a link to the chapter index page. For example:

```
poketo https://mangadex.org/manga/13127

✓ Found series: Urami koi, koi, urami koi.
⠹ Downloading 50 chapters
```

Downloading a series will also include a `.json` file with metadata about that series, and a thumbnail-sized cover image, making it good for archival purposes.

You can see all supported sites on the [poketo repository](https://github.com/poketo/poketo#supported-sites).

## Etiquette

Please be considerate to groups hosting manga series and don't use this tool to overload their servers. If you're going to download many chapters or series, do it over time.

## To-do

- [ ] Add download progress
- [ ] Add option to specify download path
- [ ] Test support for Windows computers
